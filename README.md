# KNN Intrusion Classifier
This machine learning model uses KNN classification to classify detected intrusions into 3 categories:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Malware</li>
  <li>Phishing</li>
  <li>Unauthorized Access</li>
</ul>
<br>
These can be changed and more can be added based on what your systems usually test for. <br>
